    <dt><strong>What did the client say that they want the web site to accomplish? Describe the goal of the  web site in one or two sentences.</strong></dt>
    <dd>This website is intended to create new business as well as educate the public on the historical landscape of  the city of Portland. It also is meant to present and sell a business service and to provide event data for the general public.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Who is the intended audience? Who do you think will use the website?</strong></dt>
    <dd>The intended audience are local portlanders or tourists visiting the city of Portland.</dd>
    <dt><strong>What opportunity, problem, or issue did you hear that the client wants to address?</strong></dt>
    <dd>The client intends to address the education of the pubic and visiting public on the historical Portland area using extensive knowledge gained by years of touring experience.</dd>
    <dt><strong>What does the client want the site visitors to do?</strong></dt>
    <dd>The client would like the site visitors to contact the company, share their information, and book a tour.</dd>
    <dt><strong>List at least two related or similar sites found on the Web and why you think they are related. What did you like about the websites and what do you think you could improve on for the client's website?</strong></dt>
    <dd>www.travelportland.com, the first site compared, is well set up and highly informational, but is focused on the happenings around Portland, without addressing the significance of the city. I would include the latest haps section of the client site and stress equally the touring info for a bit of background perspective. 
    The second website, www.brewvana.com, is also set up with latest style for websites, has great graphics and content, but is predominantly aimed at the brewery niche. To improve on this for the clients site, I would add the option for this info or a link, but would again focus on the nature of the client's business.</dd>
